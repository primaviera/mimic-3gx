## known issues

### "Closing the game causes a crash on real hardware"

This seems to be an issue with the plugin framework. If you are trying to compile this plugin yourself, you will probably have a better time [manually installing CTRPluginFramework with the "fb5bc8ec58f78e88f17d3f531971182642aec9ed" commit](https://gitlab.com/thepixellizeross/ctrpluginframework/-/commit/fb5bc8ec58f78e88f17d3f531971182642aec9ed)
