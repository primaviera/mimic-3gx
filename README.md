# mimic-3gx

3GX plugin for Miitopia (3DS), written for fun.

This plugin has only been tested with the US version of Miitopia, other versions might not work.

## known issues

### Closing Miitopia crashes the console

As of writing this, manually installing [CTRPluginFramework on the fb5bc8ec commit](https://gitlab.com/thepixellizeross/ctrpluginframework/-/tree/fb5bc8ec58f78e88f17d3f531971182642aec9ed) to compile the plugin seems to fix the issue.
