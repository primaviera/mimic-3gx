# mimic-3gx

3GX plugin for Miitopia (3DS), written for fun.

This plugin has only been used on the US and EU versions of Miitopia, other versions will most likely have bugs.

All of this is WIP, you can see what features have been added by looking at the [TODO list](https://github.com/primaviera/mimic-3gx/issues/1).
